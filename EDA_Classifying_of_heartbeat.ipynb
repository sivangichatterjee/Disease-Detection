Normal case\n","In the Normal category there are normal, healthy heart sounds. These may contain noise in the final second of the recording as the device is removed from the body. They may contain a variety of background noises (from traffic to radios). They may also contain occasional random noise corresponding to breathing, or brushing the microphone against clothing or skin.

Extrasystole\n","Extrasystole sounds may appear occasionally and can be identified because there is a heart sound that is out of rhythm involving extra or skipped heartbeats, e.g. a “lub-lub dub” or a “lub dub-dub”.

It can happen normally in an adult and can be very common in children. However, in some situations extrasystoles can be caused by heart diseases. If these diseases are detected earlier, then treatment is likely to be more effective.
